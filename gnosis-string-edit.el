;;; Commentary:

;; A slightly modified version of string-edit.el.  Gnosis comes with a
;; modified version string-edit.el to make gnosis available to users
;; of Emacs versions < 29.

;; Code:

(defface gnosis-string-edit-prompt

  "Face used on `gnosis-string-edit' help text."
  :group 'text)

  "Switch to a new buffer to edit STRING.
When the user finishes editing (with \\<gnosis-string-edit-mode-map>\\[gnosis-string-edit-done]), SUCCESS-CALLBACK
is called with the resulting string.

If the user aborts (with \\<gnosis-string-edit-mode-map>\\[gnosis-string-edit-abort]), ABORT-CALLBACK (if any) is
called with no parameters.

PROMPT will be inserted at the start of the buffer, but won't be
included in the resulting string.  If PROMPT is nil, no help text
will be inserted.

Also see `read-string-from-buffer'."
