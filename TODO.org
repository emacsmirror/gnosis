+ Create a dashboard to view all notes created, user can edit &
  suspend notes. Use tabulated-list-mode, preferably.
** TODO Dashboard: Improve Performance
+ emacsql is quite fast, but the current tabulated-list implementation
  can be quite slow when having >30K notes.  Consider alternatives to tabulated-list
** DONE Dashboard: Add filtering/search

- [x] Search using tags

* Misc
** DONE Refactor =completing-read= UI choices
CLOSED: [2024-02-17 Sat 21:59]
/DONE on version 0.1.7/

=completing-read= is not an ideal solution as a UI.  If user has not
enabled a completion system, such as vertico, this would make gnosis
unusable.

One possible solution is to create defcustom =gnosis-completing-read-function=
that has ido-completing-read by default if vertico/ivy/helm is not
enabled
*** Notes
Implemented =gnosis-completing-read-function=

** TODO Use vc instead of shell commands
- [x] Push & Pull commands /DONE on version 0.1.7/
- [] stage & commit
